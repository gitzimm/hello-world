# hello-world
Just my first respository

I work for a major Automotive supplier in Detroit Metro.
I have been working on SharePoint since 2012 starting as a business user and how a hack-developer.
I have been writing VBA in excel for 15 years and started dabeling in JS for SharePoint in November 2016.
No formal training in IT or writing code, just lots of on-the-job experience.
